Notes
=====
This repository contains the notes I created when preparing FRM & CFA. 
They were originally written using Microsoft Word in Mac. 
A lot of latex math formulae were used extensively, which 
unfortunately cannot be correctly recognized in Windows. 
Hence, their PDF versions are shared here.
